This is my Libgdx project for the Final Project Submission for CS487. 
You can import this project into the Intellij (Jetbrains) IDE provided you have Libgdx installed first and my project located in the libgdx installation some where.
Here is a really good project creation tutorial: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-setup,-running-&-debugging
Here is the link where you can download the current version of Libgdx: http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html
You can follows Libgdx's handy dandy readme and instructions about how to import projects into Libgdx and then Intellij.
It is also nessary to have an Android SDK already installed as well.

Once you have imported my project if necessary, the phone that was provided already has the application installed and ready to go, most of the games code is located in ./core/src/com/cs487/ace .
I have modified some the the build.gradle files within the android and core modules to accomidated some some features to the game, such as the bullet wrapper classes.
Another main location is ./android/assets which is the location for most of the models, pictures and sounds for the game that I have been working on. There is a lot of unused objects as I have had not time to clean out my directories due to time. I have modified the ./android/AndroidManifiest.xml so that the application only runs on "reverseLandscape" only.
